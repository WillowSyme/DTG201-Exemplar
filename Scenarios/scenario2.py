    "scenario" : "After lunch, Stacy heads to class. Her teacher has provided the activity for the lesson both online and on paper. The teacher has asked the students who didnâ€™t bring their device to class this lesson and will need a paper copy. Stacy did bring her device, so she can get started online. However, she could also get a paper copy from the teacher. Will she just do her work online, get a paper copy to look over then complete it online, or get a paper copy to complete by hand? The work is not technical like maths, but is a subject like English where typing the answers is straightforward.",

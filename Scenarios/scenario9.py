    "Stacy signed up to help out at her youth group picking up rubbish at the beach. She has been looking forward to doing her part, but when she woke up the morning of the event, she notices it’s all grey and dreary outside. She’s not a big fan of the cold, and knows it’s always colder by the water. What should she do? She should just call out - she won’t work well in the cold anyway. She should go, but only stay for a couple of hours. It’ll still count, right? She made a commitment to her youth group to participate. She should dress up extra warm and make the most of the grey day. Who knows? Maybe it’ll clear up later!",

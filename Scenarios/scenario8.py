    "Stacy is walking through a local park on her own. She’s enjoying the breeze and the sun on her face when one of the kids ahead of her throws his bottle into the bush next to them. They keep walking and have a laugh about it. There’s a bin not even a metre in front of them. Littering is one of Stacy’s pet peeves. What should she do? Stop the boy and make him put it in the bin, put it in the bin herself, or  just walk by and pretend she didn’t see it?",
